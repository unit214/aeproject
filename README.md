## Release Process

As `@aeternity/aeproject` has a dependency on itself for initialised project we need a 2-step release process. 

1. add preparation commit, e.g. as https://github.com/aeternity/aeproject/commit/b448b445b0d151059fd88a0436e71599be042aad
   - in `src/init/artifacts/package.json` update the `@aeternity/aeproject` to the to be released version
   - push commit to `origin/main`, the CI run will eventually fail as it can't yet use the to be released version
2. merge the release please PR
3. build and publish locally
   - checkout latest `origin/main` including the merged release please PR, ensure no local changes
   - publish to npm using `npm publish` (may require login if not already)
